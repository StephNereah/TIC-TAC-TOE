INSPIRATION:
---

The reason as to why I choose this particular project, was because I have a strong passion of one day becoming a game developer and I figured why don't I start small. 

As an enthusiast of board games, I made a list of all possible games I could make and my interest landed on the classic Tic Tac Toe
I took this as an opportunity to try create a web based version of it and also show case my love for Japan and futuristic designs, hence why the styling. 

PROJECT OVERVIEW 🎨
---
**THE GAME:**

Remember the days when all you needed was a piece of paper, a pencil, and an opponent? Well, we’ve leveled up. Now it’s just you, a 3x3 grid, and the hope that our algorithm hasn’t already predicted your every move. 😈

But fear not! We believe in you, champion. May the best player win—or at least, may you not rage quit. 🙃


FEATURES 🕹️
---

Two modes: Player vs Player (for when you can convince a friend to battle) or Player vs Algorithm (because who needs friends when you have AI?)

**Dynamic Leaderboard:** 
Track your victories, climb the ranks, and prove that you’re the ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe master.

**User Authentication:**
 Secure login so nobody steals your hard-earned victories (not that we don’t trust your friends… but just in case).

A Friendly (but deadly) Algorithm: Our AI opponent was built with love. And a tiny bit of evil genius. Play at your own risk.


ARCHITECURE 🏛️
---

*Backend:* 
Built with 🐍 Flask  Expect top-notch API handling, smooth game state management, and authentication that even hackers will respect.

*Frontend:* 
Sleek, intuitive, and designed to make you feel like you’re playing a futuristic version of Tic-Tac-Toe.

*Database:* 
Your wins are sacred. That’s why we use a reliable database to store every glorious victory (and the occasional defeat).


DATA MODELLING 🧠
---

We track game states, players, moves, and everything in between. That’s right—nothing gets past us. Not even that sneaky diagonal win you tried to pull.


USER STORIES 📖
---

As a player, I want the ability to reset the game easily and start a new match.

As a user, I want to log in so I can track my win/loss ratio and boast about it later.

As a player, I want the game to display a message when the game ends in a win, loss, or draw.

As a player, I want to play against friends or AI so I can pretend I’m strategizing.

As a competitive human, I want to see my name on the leaderboard so I can screenshot it and send it to my group chat. 😏
