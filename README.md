🎮 TIC-TAC-TOE: The Ultimate Showdown 🤖 vs 🧠
Welcome to TIC-TAC-TOE: The Ultimate Showdown, where you (the human) go head-to-head with an algorithm that doesn’t need coffee to stay sharp! This isn’t your average childhood game—oh no, this is TIC-TAC-TOE 2.0, with advanced game mechanics, a leaderboard to flex your victories, and enough back-end power to take you to the moon. 🚀 
Hey who needs friends when you can have AI (I am actually crying typing this lol)


PROJECT OVERVIEW 🎨
~THE GAME~
Remember the days when all you needed was a piece of paper, a pencil, and an opponent? Well, we’ve leveled up. Now it’s just you, a 3x3 grid, and the hope that our algorithm hasn’t already predicted your every move. 😈

But fear not! We believe in you, champion. May the best player win—or at least, may you not rage quit. 🙃


FEATURES 🕹️
Two modes: Player vs Player (for when you can convince a friend to battle) or Player vs Algorithm (because who needs friends when you have AI?)

Dynamic Leaderboard: Track your victories, climb the ranks, and prove that you’re the ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe master.
User Authentication: Secure login so nobody steals your hard-earned victories (not that we don’t trust your friends… but just in case).

A Friendly (but deadly) Algorithm: Our AI opponent was built with love. And a tiny bit of evil genius. Play at your own risk.


ARCHITECURE 🏛️
Backend: Built with 🐍 Flask (or Django), depending on how adventurous we feel. Expect top-notch API handling, smooth game state management, and authentication that even hackers will respect.

Frontend: Sleek, intuitive, and designed to make you feel like you’re playing a futuristic version of Tic-Tac-Toe.
Database: Your wins are sacred. That’s why we use a reliable database to store every glorious victory (and the occasional defeat).

Data Modeling 🧠
We track game states, players, moves, and everything in between. That’s right—nothing gets past us. Not even that sneaky diagonal win you tried to pull.


USER STORIES 📖
As a user, I want to log in so I can track my win/loss ratio and boast about it later.
As a player, I want to play against friends or AI so I can pretend I’m strategizing.
As a competitive human, I want to see my name on the leaderboard so I can screenshot it and send it to my group chat. 😏
