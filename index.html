    <h2>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>
    <br>
    <hr>

    <pre>This project was inspired by my undying love when it comes to board games and video games. 
 I grew up playing a lot of both video and board games, but a game I constantly played was Tic-Tac-Toe.
Built by a solo team of me, Stephanie Adhiambo as part of our portfolio project
 at Holberton School.

The reason why I constantly played Tic-Tac-Toe was the flexiblity, the board was simple to draw and the logic was pretty straight forward.
 So when Holberton School gave us the opportunity to work on our portfolio projects, I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

I spent too much time I admit researching and drawing how I would like the game interface to look like 
 and what theme I would settle on. I ended up settling for what I like to call "Straight out of an anime" 
theme to try incorporate my love for anime.

I also tried working on the AI concept for the first time and making it work well with the game logic.
 This was a real pain, after weeks of struggling and merging the backend and the frontend HERE WE ARE!!!
I call this the commencement of my journey to becoming a Game Dev one day. XOXO!!
